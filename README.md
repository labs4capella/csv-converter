# CSV import and export capabilities addon for Capella (MBSE)

## Purpose
Importing and exporting data with other software are key aspects for accelerating a MBSE deployment as well as easing starting modelling when content already exists.

The CSV format has been retained as it is mostly and widely used within the industries.

Another usage is to allow to map Capella's object type to another meta-model framework (DoDAF, NAF, TOGAF, etc) and simplifies the model exchange with 3rd parties, using another software and framework.

## How it works
This add-on allows to import (and takes care of creating or updating the data within the model) and export data from Capella. The whole model and data is exported, inc property values, requirements, etc by generating for each data-type a corresponding CSV file.
